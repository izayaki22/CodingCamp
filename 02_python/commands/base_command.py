TODO 3-1: The BaseCommand class has a show_usage method implemented, but the execute method is not 
implemented and is passed on to the child class. Think about why this difference is made.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
왜냐하면 ChangeDirectoryCommand, CopyCommand 등의 자식 클래스에서 execute 함수의 구현이 전부 다르기 때문에, 
부모인 BaseCommand class에 구현되어 있지 않다.

TODO 3-2: The update_current_path method of the BaseCommand class is slightly different from other methods. 
It has a @classmethod decorator and takes a cls argument instead of self. In Python, this is called a 
class method, and think about why it was implemented as a class method instead of a normal method.

Answer (You may write your answer in either Korean or English):
current_path가 class attribute이기 때문에, 각 instance에서가 아니라 class 전체에서 하나의 current_path를 update하기 위해 class method를 사용했다.
